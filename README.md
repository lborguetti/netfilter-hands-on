Course Netfilter/Iptables Hands-On
===

## Requirements

  - [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) is a command line utility for managing the life cycle of virtual machines.
  - [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)  is a general-purpose full virtualizer for x86 hardware, targeted at server, desktop and embedded use.

## Linux Networking Concepts

## What is a `computer network`?

## What is the `Internet`?

## How Does The Internet Work?

## This IP Thing

- The role of the IP layer is to figure out how to `route` packets to their final destination

- Router is a node with interfaces on more than one network

- The Linux Kernel's IP layer keeps a table of different `routes`, describing how to get to various groups of IP addresses

## Machine Names and IP Addresses (DNS)

 - [IANA - IP Addresses](https://www.iana.org/numbers) - responsible for global coordination of the Internet Protocol addressing systems, as well as the Autonomous System Numbers used for routing Internet traffic.
 - [IANA - Root Servers](https://www.iana.org/domains/root/servers) - responsible for management of the DNS root zone. This role means assigning the operators of top-level domains, such as .uk and .com, and maintaining their technical and administrative details.

## Different Services: Email, Web, FTP, Name Serving

- TCP and UDP have a concept of `ports`.
- [IANA - Protocol Registries](https://www.iana.org/protocols) - responsible for maintaining many of the codes and numbers contained in a variety of Internet protocols, enumerated below. We provide this service in coordination with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

## Environment Setup

Clone this repo and run:

```
vagrant up
```

At this point the Vagrant created 4 VMs (router, node1, node2, server).

Check the status of VMs

```
vagrant status
```

The diagram bellow represent the network connection between this VMs


![Network Diagram](https://github.com/lborguetti/netfilter-hands-on/raw/master/docs/networking-diagram.dot.png)


## Network

### Connect to each VM and check the network and routing table settings and take notes.###

```
vagrant ssh VM-NAME
```

```
ip address show
ip route show
cat /etc/resolv.conf
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

or

```
ifconfig -a
route -n
cat /etc/resolv.conf
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

### Check the network connectivity and take notes.

**router VM**

```
ping 192.168.20.10 # server vm
ping 172.16.10.10 # node1 vm
ping 172.16.10.11 # node2 vm
ping 8.8.8.8
dig @8.8.8.8 www.google.com
curl -v https://www.google.com
```

**server VM**

```
ping 192.168.20.2 # router vm
ping 172.16.10.10 # node1 vm
ping 172.16.10.11 # node2 vm
ping 8.8.8.8
dig @8.8.8.8 www.google.com
curl -v https://www.google.com
```

**node1 VM**

```
ping 172.16.10.2 # router vm
ping 172.16.10.11 # node2 vm
ping 192.168.20.10 # server vm
ping 8.8.8.8
dig @8.8.8.8 www.google.com
curl -v https://www.google.com
```

**node2 VM**

```
ping 172.16.10.2 # router vm
ping 172.16.10.10 # node1 vm
ping 192.168.20.10 # server vm
ping 8.8.8.8
dig @8.8.8.8 www.google.com
curl -v https://www.google.com
```

### Set the default route and take notes.

**server VM**

```
vagrant ssh server
```

```
ip route add default via 192.168.20.2
```

or

```
route add default gw 192.168.20.2
```

**node1 VMs**

```
vagrant ssh node1
```

```
ip route add default via 172.16.10.2
```

or

```
route add default gw 192.168.20.2
```

**node2 VMs**

```
vagrant ssh node2
```

```
ip route add default via 172.16.10.2
```

or

```
route add default gw 192.168.20.2
```

**Check the network connectivity again.**

Questions?

### Enable router ip_forward

```
ip_forward - BOOLEAN
  0 - disabled (default)
  not 0 - enabled

    Forward Packets between interfaces.

    This variable is special, its change resets all configuration
    parameters to their default state (RFC1122 for hosts, RFC1812
    for routers)
```

https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt


```
vagrant ssh router
```

```
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```

Enable ip_forward permanently. Edit */etc/sysctl.conf* and add: `net.ipv4.ip_forward=1`

**Check the network connectivity again.**

## Netfilter/Iptables

### So What's A Packet Filter?

- A packet filter is a piece of software which looks at the header of packets as they pass through, and decides the fate of the entire packet

- It might decide to DROP the packet, ACCEPT the packet, or something more complicated (NAT)

### Why Would I Want to Packet Filter?

- Control. Security. Watchfulness

### How Do I Packet Filter Under Linux?

- [Netfilter](https://netfilter.org/) - is a set of hooks inside the Linux kernel that allows kernel modules to register callback functions with the network stack. A registered callback function is then called back for every packet that traverses the respective hook within the network stack.

- [Iptables](https://netfilter.org/projects/iptables/index.html) - is a generic table structure for the definition of rulesets. Each rule within an IP table consists of a number of classifiers (iptables matches) and one connected action (iptables target).

### How Packets Traverse The Filters

![Routing tables traversal process](http://ebtables.netfilter.org/br_fw_ia/bridge3b.png)


### Using iptables

iptables/ip6tables - administration tool for IPv4/IPv6 packet filtering and NAT

- Several different tables may be defined.
- Each table contains a number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.
- Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets.
- Each rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches (TARGET).

**TARGETS**:

- `DROP`
- `ACCEPT`
- `RETURN`
- Or jump to a  user-defined chain in the same table.

**TABLES**:

- `filter` - INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD
- `nat` - PREROUTING, INPUT, OUTPUT, POSTROUTING
- `mangle` - PREROUTING, OUTPUT, INPUT, FORWARD, POSTROUTING
- `raw` - PREROUTING, OUTPUT
- `security` - INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD (SECMARK, CONNSECMARK)


### Hands-on


```
vagrant ssh node1
```

Open a new shell

```
vagrant ssh router
```

```
man iptables
```

#### View current configuration

`router` and `node1`:

```
iptables -t mangle -L -nv
iptables -t nat -L -nv
iptables -t filter -L -nv
```

> Note: `--line-numbers`


#### Change the policy for a built-in chain INPUT. (-P).

`node1`

```
ping -c 3 172.16.10.2
```

`router`

```
iptables -t filter -P INPUT DROP
```

`node1`

```
ping -c 3 172.16.10.2
```

#### Create/Delete a new rule to a chain INPUT.

- Append a new rule to a chain (-A).
- Insert a new rule at some position in a chain (-I).
- Replace a rule at some position in a chain (-R).
- Delete a rule at some position in a chain, or the first that matches (-D).

`router`

```
iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
```

`node1`

```
ping -c 3 172.16.10.2
```

`router`

```
iptables -t filter -D INPUT -p icmp -j ACCEPT
```

#### Change the policy for a built-in chain FORWARD. (-P).

`node1`

```
ping -c 3 192.168.20.10
```

`router`

```
iptables -t filter -P FORWARD DROP
```

`node1`

```
ping -c 3 172.16.10.2
```

`router`

```
iptables -t filter -P FORWARD ACCEPT
```

#### Create/Delete a new rule to a chain FORWARD.

- Append a new rule to a chain (-A).
- Insert a new rule at some position in a chain (-I).
- Replace a rule at some position in a chain (-R).
- Delete a rule at some position in a chain, or the first that matches (-D).

`router`

```
iptables -t filter -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -t filter -A FORWARD -p icmp -j ACCEPT
```

`node1`

```
ping -c 3 192.168.20.10
```
